			<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/lLeCB7Kn-VE?t=13" style="font-weight: 900;">hello, it's me. i've thought about us for a long, long time... (what?)</a>
			<p><br>quinten laurènce sol (they/them) is a creative peculiarity currently habited in rotterdam, the netherlands...
			<br>they write, sing, produce, mix, code and design, and also likes to discover new music, read, or just drift away from the world from time to time.
			<br><br>their current occupation is a solo musical project called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/_horizonsband/"><b>INDIGO CHAMBER</b></a>, which could be described as dreamy pop music with swoony falsettos, languid melodies, sultry synths, intimate poetry and ethereal guitarlines, originating from some place far away from our known universe.
			<br><br>currently a student of Music and Technology at HKU University of the Arts, they recently conquered their place in cyberspace because apparently, coding your own site is all the rage nowadays!
			<br><br>they are also in a band called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/_horizonsband/"><b>HORIZONS</b></a> where they make silky smooth sailin' yachtrock and easy-listening cocktail party AOR to escape from all your earthly troubles.
			<p><br><br>if you want to check out what they have made so far, you can navigate to the 'work' tab on the left.</p>
			<p>they are also available for mixing, producing and recording duties for other people in a wide range of styles.
				<br>so if you are interested in their mixing work, please go to the 'contact' tab to shoot them a mail, 
				and who knows something magical will happen!</p>
			
		
			<!--<p><br>quinten sol (they/them) is a creative peculiarity currently habited in rotterdam, the netherlands. -->
			<!--    <br>although they never had formal training or education in music, -->
			<!--    they write, produce, record and mix their music all by themselves. how impressive!</p>-->
			<!--<p>their solo work is released under the INDIGO CHAMBER project. -->
			<!--    <br>although they prefer not to label their music, one could categorize it as either dreampop, shoegaze, or shoegaze.-->
			<!--    <br>or, as they likes to call it, "sweet pop melodies hidden under shiny, ethereal layers of reverb".</p>-->

			<p>
			dear reading person...


			do you ever feel too scared to ask for help?
			
			like, did you ever have moments where you maybe needed to talk some shit out but you didn't?
			
			maybe because you were scared of being judged...
			or you'd rather tell yourself that 'it isn't important enough anyways'...
			
			while you knew that talking it out was objectively the best thing to do?
			
			
			it happens a lot more than most people suspect, and in a lot more situations than just asking for a hand.. not saying shit when you should be.
			
			
			
			
			today i want to tell you a story, if you please, about how not asking for advice can make your life a whole lot more difficult.
			
			
			i'm gonna be honest with you. i think i went crazy a few years ago.
			
			during the quarantine, i had this pervasive and stubborn idea that if i could just give enough effort and time, i could make an entire album from my own bedroom.
			i had to just lock myself in my attic, force myself to buckle up and just fucking do the work. producing, writing, recording, mixing it, 
			all on my own. 
			
			it's a funny idea, i know, but just the allure of succeeding drove me forwards. and maybe it was a bit of ego, too.
			i had the tools, the musicality and my mind. technically, i thought, i should be able to make an entire record from my bedroom.
			
			
			but guess what? i was so stubborn in wanting to reinvent the wheel, that i completely lost myself in doubt.
			
			so while i technically learnt and 'did' the things i had to do...
			i forgot how it felt to let ideas come in a natural way,
			i learnt to force out music, out of desperation, not inspiration,
			and i lost touch with myself and what made me want to create art in the first place.
			
			
			i lost perspective and a healthy overview. and planning is unfortunately not one of my strengths (i have ADD)
			so yeah, surprise surprise, after two years, i still had nothing to show for it.
			
			and all of that could have been avoided... if i just asked someone for advice.
			
			
			
			
			i don't have any regrets obviously but i do feel like you can easily be too hard on yourself by not wanting to ask for advice or help.
			it's a bit strange to want it anyways. it's an interesting experiment surely but there's no good reason to try it...
			
			in the end, i noticed, it will only make you feel more cynical and jaded about yourself.
			
			
			i even wrote a song about this... more on that another time.
			
			
			for now i hope that if you read this till the end, or even if you just scrolled down to see what i had to say...
			
			
			don't ever doubt asking people for help when you need it.
			
			you'd be surprised at how many people, acquaintances or strangers, are willing to drop everything they're doing
			to help you out. i see it all the time, like in public transport, people shooting by to help a disabled person get in the metro.
			so ask people for help.
			
			
			i hope this email finds you well.
			
			until next time.
			
			quinten
