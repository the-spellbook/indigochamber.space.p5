    <a href="https://youtu.be/lLeCB7Kn-VE?t=13" style="font-weight: 900;">hello, it's me. i've thought about us for a long, long time... (what?)</a>
        <p><br>quinten laur√®nce sol (they/them) is a creative peculiarity currently habited in rotterdam, the netherlands...
        <br>they write, sing, produce, mix, code and design, and also likes to discover new music, read, or just disassociate from the real world from time to time.
        <br><br>their current occupation is a solo musical project called INDIGO CHAMBER, which could be described as dreamy pop music with swoony falsettos, languid melodies, sultry synths, intimate poetry and ethereal guitarlines, originating from some place far away from our known universe.
        <br><br>currently a student of Music and Technology at HKU University of the Arts, they recently conquered their place in cyberspace because apparently, coding your own site is all the rage nowadays!
        <br><br>they are also in a band called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_horizonsband/"><b>Horizons</b></a> where they make silky smooth sailin' yachtrock and easy-listening cocktail party AOR to escape from all your earthly troubles.
        <p><br><br>if you want to check out what they have made so far, you can navigate to the 'work' tab on the left.</p>
        <p>they are also available for mixing, producing and recording duties for other people in a wide range of styles.
            <br>so if you are interested in their mixing work, please go to the 'contact' tab to shoot them a mail, 
            and who knows something magical will happen!</p>
        
    
        <!--<p><br>quinten sol (they/them) is a creative peculiarity currently habited in rotterdam, the netherlands. -->
        <!--    <br>although they never had formal training or education in music, -->
        <!--    they write, produce, record and mix their music all by themselves. how impressive!</p>-->
        <!--<p>their solo work is released under the INDIGO CHAMBER project. -->
        <!--    <br>although they prefer not to label their music, one could categorize it as either dreampop, shoegaze, or shoegaze.-->
        <!--    <br>or, as they likes to call it, "sweet pop melodies hidden under shiny, ethereal layers of reverb".</p>-->

hello, it's me. i've thought about us for a long time.

hey! leuk dat je kijkt op mijn site. ik ben quinten en ik maak veel muziek in mijn vrije tijd. 
in mijn home studio schrijf ik nieuwe muziek, neem ik het op, en mix ik het.
ik maak vaak muziek in de genre's van indie pop, dreampop en soft rock.

Hello, it's me. I've thought about us for a long long time.

I am a multi-instrumentalist, mixing engineer, producer, musician and plumber living in the beautiful city of Rotterdam.
Since I was a 10 year old little boy, I've been playing guitar and piano, and getting familiar with the heart of music.
Using a little app called Garageband I recorded all of my musical ideas and mixed them. 
Now, I write, record and work out songs in Ableton in my little attic, sometimes with others too. 
I like to make music with my friends, and I also make a lot of music myself. I love to help them record and work out musical ideas they have.

I specialize in the genres of indiepop, indierock, dreampop, generally everything which sounds out of this world.
So if you need a song to be recorded or an album to be mixed, be sure to contact me (see contact page). 
I generally work in the broad area of indiepop/acoustic guitar, but I love a good vibe and I'm generally pretty open to new ideas.
